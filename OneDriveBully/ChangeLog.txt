						1) Changed temp file handling from create/delete to create/rename
							- This change will
								- Reduce the OneDrive log from 2 entries (Create/Delete) to only 1 (Rename)
								- Keep OneDrive Recycle Bin clean
						2) Added instructions MessageBox on first load/first close of the app
							- This should make it clear to all users that the app is minimized on system tray and the possible actions you have available
						3) Added new setting to show Instructions on next Exit
							- In case the user wants a reminder
						4) Fixed issue with folder paths containing non english characters
						5) Fixed all function names to follow .net naming standard (1st letter capitalized)
						6) Fixed issue on Settings form when there are no symbolic links and Delete button is pressed.
